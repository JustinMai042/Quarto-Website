Hello! My name is Justin Mai and I am currently attending California Polytechnic State University San Luis Obispo, I am majoring in statistics and want to pursue the data science track. Welcome to my website here you can find some of my projects and my contact information. 

                                                       

Since there is some space left. Here are a few fun facts about me:

- I love snowboarding during the winter months, carving down the slopes and enjoying the fresh mountain air.

- Climbing is another passion of mine. I mostly indoor boulder over the summer.

- Video games are a big part of my downtime, I enjoy playing them to pass time or playing them to avoid assigments.

- My first and only snowboard was bought from a man behing a walmart for 100 dollars
